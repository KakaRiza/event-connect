This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

## Git Operations

### Pull from GitHub

To get the latest changes from the remote repository:

```bash
# Pull changes from the main branch
git pull origin main

# Or pull from a specific branch
git pull origin <branch-name>
```

### Push to GitHub

To push your local changes to the remote repository:

```bash
# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit your changes with a message
git commit -m "Your commit message"

# Push to the main branch
git push origin main

# Or push to a specific branch
git push origin <branch-name>
```

### Common Git Workflow

1. Check current branch and status:
```bash
git status
git branch
```

2. Pull latest changes before working:
```bash
git pull origin main
```

3. Make your changes to the code

4. Stage, commit, and push:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Description of your changes"
git push origin main
```
